# Zachary Henderson's First CS193 Homework

## My favorite things about CS193
- I like how students run the class as it creates a level of connection with them knowing they won't mess you over or do something that they would've hated when they were in your shoes 2 years ago
- I like how everyone in the class is very calm and pays attention as it helps for me to focus easily
- I also like how the class has very clear instructions on almost everything in terms of homework as it makes it very easy to then study or complete problems
